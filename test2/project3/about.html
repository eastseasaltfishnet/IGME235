            <p>
                "A web-based interactive 3D model viewer seamlessly integrated into my portfolio, <br>
                allowing users to explore and interact with actual 3D models while showed in project1<br>
                will allow the user to jump form project 1 to see the model here

                The reason I only uploaded one image is that this is essentially how it is going to look.<br>
                I never done something like this before, so I want your feedback on whether this idea seems too easy or too challenging.<br>
                If it is too challenging, I will adjust my plan and send another proposal as soon as possible.<br>
                If it is too easy, I am considering adding an interactive feature to make the tank in my portfolio drivable on the website."

            <h2>External Libraries/Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Three.js for 3D rendering,I just google it to see how to add 3D model and find this three.js, <br>
                if there are any better option please let me know OrbitControls for interaction.
