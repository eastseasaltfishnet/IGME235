        <h2>2. Layout Sketches</h2>
        <p>Here are the sketches and plans for the grid layout. I feel like this layout is more suited for phones,</p>
        <p>so I basically just made a few optimizations for the section part.</p>

        <h2>5. Challenges and Key Decisions</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed learning new tools that can create interesting effects. One of the challenges I faced was figuring
            out how to achieve the stair-step effect at the bottom of the front page. Through this, I learned how to use
            specific child selectors in CSS, which became one of my favorite features of the project.</p>
        <p>The most frustrating part of the process was when I modified the CSS and saw no response, leading me to
            question whether it was a CSS issue. In the end, it often turned out to be a simple spelling error in the
            HTML.</p>

        <h2>5. Link Styles</h2>
        <p>I implemented custom link styles using the following states:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Default link color:</strong> Deep Blue </li>
            <li><strong>Visited link color:</strong> Brown</li>
            <li><strong>Hover link color:</strong> Underlined and remains deep blue for consistency</li>
            <li><strong>Active link color:</strong> Red with underline</li>
            <li><strong>Focus link style:</strong> Outline of 2px solid blue</li>
        </ul>
